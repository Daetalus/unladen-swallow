This where Unladen Swallow keeps its vendor branches for third-party apps and
libraries we will want to ship with Unladen Swallow. We import the virgin source
trees into vendor/, then copy the tree into trunk/. Any modifications should be
made in trunk and pushed upstream; these will be incorporated into future
source drops into vendor/.

If the third-party app/library is only used for benchmarks or correctness tests
-- that is, it won't actually ship with Unladen Swallow -- please put those
under tests/lib/.

The vendor/scripts/ directory contains tools to help with managing vendor
branches:
  * svn_load_dirs.pl: load a vendor source drop into a vendor branch.

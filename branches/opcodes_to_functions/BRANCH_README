branches/opcodes_to_functions

This branch explores converting already-slow/infrequent opcodes (like
LOAD_LOCALS) to function calls. The hypothesis is that doing so will save icache and dcache space, thus leading to increased performance.

The import magic number will be increased with every commit to this branch, but will be re-adjusted downwards when merged to trunk.

Opcodes targeted for removal:
	- LOAD_LOCALS (done)
	- BUILD_CLASS (done)
	- MAKE_FUNCTION
	- EXEC_STMT (done)
	- PRINT_*

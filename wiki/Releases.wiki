#summary Unladen Swallow Releases

Unladen Swallow is released every three months, with bug-fix releases in between as needed. 2009Q1 was released in late March 2009, 2009Q2 will be released in late June 2009, 2009Q3 in late September 2009, and so on.


  * *[Release2009Q1]* (Released: 1 April 2009).<br>Features a new, faster interpreter loop based on [http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/vmgen/ vmgen]; the `cPickle` module has been sped up significantly.

  * *[Release2009Q2]* (Released: 13 July 2009).<br>First release to be based on [http://llvm.org/ LLVM], which is used to compile CPython bytecode to machine code. All Python code can be translated to machine code, and all tests pass for major projects like Twisted, Django, Swig and NumPy. Interpreter startup has been improved over 2009Q1. The 2009Q2 release is intended as a progress checkpoint, rather than a target for general adoption. This release sets the stage for more aggressive optimizations in Q3.

#summary Unladen Swallow Releases

Unladen Swallow is released every three months, with bug-fix releases in between as needed.

= 2009Q1 =

The first release. Unladen Swallow 2009Q1 is based on CPython 2.6.1. This release is primarily a collection of tweaks to 2.6.1, most of which are now available in mainline Python trunk.

== Performance ==

We recommend building Unladen Swallow with 64-bit mode for maximum performance. The following timings are comparing virgin Python 2.6.1 against Unladen Swallow 2009Q1 in 64-bit mode. Compiled with gcc 4.3.1 on Intel Core 2 Duo machines. See the [Benchmarks] page for a description of each benchmark below. If you have access to gcc 4.4, we highly recommend using the FDO support (via `--fprofile-generate` and `--fprofile-use`). We have found that training it on 2to3, Django and SlowSpitfire (via `test.py`) adds additional 10-30% percent performance, depending on the benchmark.

Note on the benchmark names: the SlowFoo benchmarks are pure-Python versions. So SlowPickle is a pure-Python version of Pickle, which uses the `cPickle` module.

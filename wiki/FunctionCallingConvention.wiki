#summary A function calling convention for LLVM functions

LLVM functions need to know what parameters to expect from their environment. This is similar to the various C calling conventions defined in [http://docs.python.org/c-api/structures.html#PyMethodDef PyMethodDef]. Initially, I think I'll arrange for LLVM functions to resemble METH_KEYWORDS C functions, except they'll need a few extra arguments. The whole list of arguments is:

   # The PyFrameObject being called. The PyCodeObject is accessible through this.
   # self
   # args tuple
   # kwargs dict

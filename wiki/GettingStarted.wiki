#summary How to build Unladen Swallow

Setting up Unladen Swallow uses the same procedure as setting up CPython:

{{{
> svn checkout http://unladen-swallow.googlecode.com/svn/branches/release-2009Q1-maint unladen
...
> cd unladen
> ./configure
...
> make
...
> ./python.exe
Python 2.6.1 (r261:311:312M, Mar 24 2009, 23:24:25) 
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5490)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
}}}

This will checkout and build [Releases our 2009Q1 release]. Note that our `tests/` top-level directory uses Subversion 1.5-style relative `svn:externals` properties; accordingly, you'll need [http://subversion.tigris.org/ SVN 1.5 or higher]. Active development is being done in `trunk/`, which can be checked out from `http://unladen-swallow.googlecode.com/svn/trunk`. Note that trunk includes a copy of LLVM and will take longer to build.

If your system is a 32/64-bit hybrid (say, a 64-bit kernel but a 32-bit userspace), you'll need to run a different `./configure` command. In the case of a 32-bit userspace, something like this should work:
{{{
CFLAGS=-m32 CXXFLAGS=-m32 ./configure --build=i386-unknown-linux-gnu
}}}

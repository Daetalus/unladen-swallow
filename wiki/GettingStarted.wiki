#summary How to build Unladen Swallow

Setting up Unladen Swallow uses the same procedure as setting up CPython:

{{{
> svn checkout http://unladen-swallow.googlecode.com/svn/branches/release-2009Q1-maint unladen
...
> cd unladen
> ./configure
...
> make
...
> ./python.exe
Python 2.6.1 (r261:311:312M, Mar 24 2009, 23:24:25) 
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5490)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
}}}

This will checkout and build [Releases our 2009Q1 release]. Note that our `tests/` top-level directory uses Subversion 1.5-style relative `svn:externals` properties; accordingly, you'll need [http://subversion.tigris.org/ SVN 1.5 or higher]. Active development is being done in `trunk/`, which can be checked out from `http://unladen-swallow.googlecode.com/svn/trunk`. Note that trunk includes a copy of LLVM 2.5 and will take longer to build.

Any patches should be put on http://codereview.appspot.com and sent to [http://groups.google.com/group/unladen-swallow unladen-swallow@googlegroups.com] for pre-commit review.

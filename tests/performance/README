This directory contains both macro- and micro-benchmarks for Python implementations. Note that most of these benchmarks are "micro" in some way, with some (like those in the first section) being less-than-ideal predictors of real application performance. For that reason, you should focus on benchmarks like 2to3 and Spitfire, rather than pybench.


Crap benchmarks used for historical comparisons:
    - pybench/: PyBench 2.0 benchmark suite.
    - pystone.py: standard PyStone benchmark.
    - richards.py: standard Richards benchmark.
      Copied from PyPy's pypy/translator/goal/richards.py, r60845.


Macro(ish)benchmarks:
    - gcbench.py: GC benchmark (allocate and deallocate lots of objects).
      Copied from PyPy's pypy/translator/goal/gcbench.py, r60845.


Microbenchmarks:
    - micro_tuple_gc_hell.py: stress the GC by allocating lots of tuples.

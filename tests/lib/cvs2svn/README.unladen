This is cvs2svn trunk r4825, minus some tests. No released version of cvs2svn
worked well with mainline Python 2.6.1.

The following tests are disabled because of an incompatibility with
Subversion 1.6 (http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=124):

69: eol settings and mime types together...variant 2
